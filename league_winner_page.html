       <h1>2023-2024 League Winner</h1>
       <h2>Jimmy Dromgoole</h2>
      <p>The first winner in league history belongs to Jimmy D after he defeated Cole by a score of 164.80-148.96 in what was no doubt a full circle moment for the both of them. For years Jimmy had to endure endless amounts of "you have no rings" from Cole and others referring to almost a decade of playing redraft. Now Jimmy got his sweet revenge on Cole and the rest of the league by earning the first and only ring in the dynasty leagues' history. Which means he gets to tell everyone about how they have no rings and he has the most in league history for at least the next year. Key performances that helped Jimmy secure the victory included Breece Hall scoring 27.6 points, Kyren Williams 30.1 points, DJ Moore 30.9 points, and De'von Achane 23.7 points. Jimmy finished the regular season in 4th place and torched his way through Terch and Brad en route to his victory over Cole in the championship. With a very young and talented roster, it's of no surprise Jimmy is set to be a contender and potential DYNASTY franchise over the next few years. The question is...who will defeat him?</p>
