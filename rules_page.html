        <h1>League Rules</h1>
        <ol class="rules__ol">
            <li>Before rookie draft you have to have the amount of empty bench spots as you have picks in the draft. (If you have 7 picks you need to have 7 empty bench spots going into draft.)</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you do not set your lineup for the week, you owe $25 to the league pot. Every week must have a full playing lineup.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rookie draft first 3 picks are lottery. Rest is based off finish in the league. Fixed draft not snake.</li>
            <br>
            <li>We will take league vote on if someone is making a bad trade or if we believe it’s collusion. If majority vote is yes for a bad trade but no collusion is thought to be involved it has the right to be vetoed. If the trade is proven collusion you either owe a $200 fine or both members are removed from the league.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Fines need to be paid within a week of transaction. If not you will have to pay a late fee. ($10 extra a day)</li>
            <br>
            <li>There are now no divisions. It will be rankings 1-10 with the top 6 making playoffs.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Tanking is allowed but only if you are blowing up your team for the future. For example if you feel you are not a contender, you can trade your players for future assets as long as you are still starting your best players every week. If you are not starting your best players every week to tank while still being a contending team you will be fined $200 if the league vote is majority yes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rookie draft lottery odds are 40/33/27</li>
            <br>
            <li>You must pay the commish before season starts or you will be fined an extra $10 every week it's not paid.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Draft picks can be traded up to 3 years from current year. For example, this year you can trade 2024, 2025, and 2026 picks but anything past that is not allowed.</li>
